* FRP focusses on values that change over time
* Functional:
  * Computation as application of functions
  * Stateless
  * Avoiding side effects

* FRP
  * Dynamic values are "first class", can be combined, passed around
  * Events are a discrete datatype with a time and a value


* Bacon
  * FRP lib for JS
  * EventStreams, can be created from multiple sources
    * From dom events
    * From promises
    * etc
  * Can subscribe to event streams, and do side effect things on them
